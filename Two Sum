/*
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
*/


// Algorithm:

F(nums, target)
sort array nums
for i in range (0, n):
  binary search (target - nums[i]) in nums[i+1: n]
  
// Run time analysis:
Sorting takes O(nlg n)time. There are at most n iterations to scan through the array. Each iterations takes O(lg n) at most. Hence the total runtime is O(n lg n).
